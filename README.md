# Etch-a-Sketch Web App ðŸŽ¨

A simple **Etch-a-Sketch style web app** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Draw on a dynamic grid with **progressive darkening squares**, **reset**, and **custom grid size**.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Size**: Enter the number of squares per side to create a grid (e.g., 4x4, 16x16, 32x32).  
- **Progressive Darkening**: Each square darkens progressively by 10% per hover. Full opacity after 10 hovers.  
- **Reset Button**: Clears the grid and lets you set a new size.  
- **Responsive Grid**: The grid fits within a 450x450px container.

## What I Learned & Implemented

- **DOM Manipulation**
  - Created and appended grid squares dynamically using `document.createElement` and `appendChild`.
  - Cleared and rebuilt the grid using `container.innerHTML = ""` for resets.

- **Event Handling**
  - Added `mouseover` events for progressive darkening.
  - Added `click` events for resetting the grid and handling user input.

- **Dataset Attributes**
  - Used `data-colorCounter` to track hover counts per square.
  - Learned to read and update dataset values dynamically in JavaScript.

- **Progressive Darkening Logic**
  - Implemented gradual color opacity increase (10% per hover) using `rgba`.
  - Ensured each square reaches full opacity after 10 hovers.

- **Responsive Grid Calculation**
  - Dynamically calculated square size based on container size and user input (`450 / gridSize`).
  - Ensured the grid always fits within the container without overflow.

- **User Interaction**
  - Prompted user for grid size to create customizable grids.
  - Experimented with color picker for user-selected colors (optional, removed for simplicity).

- **Code Organization**
  - Encapsulated grid creation in a reusable `defaultGrid(size)` function.
  - Learned about variable scoping and event listeners inside functions.

- **Styling & Layout**
  - Used CSS Flexbox for grid layout.
  - Applied borders, spacing, and hover effects for visual clarity.
